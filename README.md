Sorting algorithms gives us an opportunity to put elements in ascending or descending orders 
There are several types of sorting algoirthms such as selection,insertion, quick , merge and bubble sort. The Bubble sort works following way
if we have an array it passes through array and compare the elements.For example, it compares the first and the second item if the second item is bigger
than the first one it continue to compare with the third item. If the third one is less than the first one it swaps the first and the third one.
So, it passes through the array and check all items until the last one. It continues to pass (n-1) times.

Doubly linked list consists of nodes and each node has three parts. Two parts show the previous and the next nodes and the the other one has 
data on it.
