Stack- Stack is a linear data structure which works followig way,existing item is removed and the new item is added.
       We should use LIFO implementation which means last-in and first-out. If we mant to add an item we should remove
       a iteam from the top and add it. Push,pop and is_empty are methods which are used in stack.
       
       MyStack-  creats and empty stack 
       Push(item)__ adds an item to the top
       Pop(item) - Removing an element from the Stack
       isEmpty  -  Returns True if the stack is empty or False otherwise
       
Complexity -  O(1) for push and pop methods
